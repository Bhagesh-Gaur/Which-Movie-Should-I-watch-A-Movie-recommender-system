# ML_Project22
Movie Recommender System 
The project was based on building a low-level assembler and simulator for the Simple-RISC ISA using high-level language.
  
### For further information refer to the Project Description pdf.

* Both the assembler and the simulator read from `stdin`.
* Both the assembler and the simulator write to `stdout`.

## How to run?
* Go to the `Simple-Assembler` directory and execute the `run` file with appropriate options passed as arguments.
* Go to the `SimpleSimulator` directory and execute the `run` file with appropriate options passed as arguments.

## How to run automated tester?
* Go to the `automatedTesting` directory and execute the `run` file with appropriate options passed as arguments.
* Options available for automated testing:
	1. `--verbose`: Prints verbose output
	2. `--no-asm`: Does not evaluate the assembler
	3. `--no-sim`: Does not evaluate the simulator
