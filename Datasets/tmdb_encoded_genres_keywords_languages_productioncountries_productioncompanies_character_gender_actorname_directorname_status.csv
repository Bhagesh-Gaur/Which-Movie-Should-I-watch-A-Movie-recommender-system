Whoever tries to get in their way, they will show no mercy. This puts the police force to shame and humiliation. A hardboiled senior police inspector Lui, hot on the trails of Nam and his tight crew, determines to put an end to this madness that causes the lives of innocent people. But he soon comes face to face with the cruel reality that the usual police tactics are too futile to send these armed thieves behind bars. Extreme crime requires extreme justice, even if it means crossing his moral line. Tou, an ex-con desperate to leave his criminal past behind, volunteers to be Lui’s snitch in exchange for a fresh start with her girlfriend Bing. But little does he know what hellish situation he’s getting himself into.",3.376967,2013-12-12,0,110.0,,Firestorm,5.9,43,"[0, 4]","[1427, 6786, 4169, 6787]","[1783, 2497, 2498]","[22, 10]","[7, 24]",7,"[23041, 34213, 34214, 23211, 34215, 34216, 34217, 34218, 34219, 34220, 34221, 34222]","[45431, 45432, 45433, 45434, 18317, 3290, 3290, 3290, 3290, 3290, 3290, 45435]",10,0,2,972,1

Instead of going to Vietnam, Wordsworth goes off to fight against the French while Coleridge stays at home and promotes utopianism. After the war, the poets live and work together with Coleridge's wife, Sara (Samantha Morton), and Wordsworth's sister, Dorothy (Emily Woof). At first this communal arrangement works to the advantage of Coleridge--who does some of his best writing while Wordsworth stagnates--until Coleridge becomes addicted to opium. Wordsworth, meanwhile, doesn't find his voice until he abandons his friend.
